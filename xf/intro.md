## Project Overview

This is the **CVI AliOS Open SDK** - a comprehensive software development kit for **Sophgo Technology's** CV181x and CV180x series processors. It's designed for edge computing applications, particularly IP cameras and smart devices.

## Key Components

### **Target Processors**
- **CV181x series**: High-performance RISC-V processors with TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)
- **CV180x series**: Lower-power RISC-V processors
- Both support AI acceleration and multimedia processing

### **Project Structure**

1. **`boards/`** - Hardware board configurations and BSP (Board Support Package)
2. **`components/`** - Core software components including:
   - **AOS kernel** (AliOS Things operating system)
   - **CSI drivers** (Camera Serial Interface)
   - **Multimedia frameworks** (audio/video processing)
   - **AI/ML libraries** (TPU SDK, computer vision)
   - **Network stack** (WiFi, Bluetooth, Ethernet)
   - **Security components** (encryption, secure boot)

3. **`solutions/`** - Ready-to-use application solutions:
   - **`smart_doorbell`** - Smart doorbell with video streaming
   - **`ipc`** - IP camera solution
   - **`usb_cam`** - USB camera functionality
   - **`smart_pad`** - Smart tablet/pad solution
   - **`sophpi`** - Raspberry Pi-like development board
   - **`peripherals_test`** - Hardware testing suite

4. **`docs/`** - Comprehensive documentation
5. **`host-tools/`** - Cross-compilation toolchain

## Key Features

### **AI & Computer Vision**
- **TPU acceleration** for neural network inference
- **Computer Vision SDK** (CVI TDL) with object detection, face recognition
- **ISP (Image Signal Processor)** support for camera optimization
- **Multiple sensor support** (GC2053, GC2093, OV5647, etc.)

### **Multimedia Capabilities**
- **Video encoding/decoding** (H.264, H.265)
- **Audio processing** (AAC, G.711, AMR, Opus)
- **Real-time streaming** (RTSP, UVC)
- **Image processing** and enhancement

### **Connectivity**
- **WiFi** (multiple chip support: RTL8723DS, Hi3861L)
- **Bluetooth** (BLE mesh support)
- **Ethernet** connectivity
- **USB** (host/device modes)

### **Development Features**
- **OTA (Over-The-Air) updates**
- **Secure boot** and encryption
- **Real-time operating system** (AliOS Things)
- **Rich peripheral support** (GPIO, I2C, SPI, UART, PWM)

## Use Cases

This SDK is primarily designed for:

1. **IP Cameras** - Security cameras with AI features
2. **Smart Doorbells** - Video doorbells with person detection
3. **IoT Devices** - Smart home appliances
4. **Edge AI Applications** - Local AI processing without cloud dependency
5. **Development Boards** - Prototyping and learning

## Development Workflow

The project uses a **YoC (Yun on Chip)** build system:
- **Cross-compilation** with RISC-V toolchain
- **Component-based architecture** for modular development
- **Configuration-driven** build system via `package.yaml`
- **Multiple deployment options** (TF card, USB, OTA)

This is essentially a complete embedded Linux-like development environment specifically optimized for Sophgo's AI-capable RISC-V processors, making it ideal for developing smart camera and IoT applications with local AI processing capabilities.
